This project aims to predict house prices in Chennai, India, based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. We have developed a machine learning model to make accurate price predictions, and this README file provides information on how to use the model and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- XGBoost (for advanced modeling)
- Pickle (for saving and loading trained models)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost
```



## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hari-durai/chennai_house_price_prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd chennai-house-price-prediction
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to perform data preparation, model training, and evaluation.



This will load the trained model and provide an interactive prompt to enter house details. The script will then predict the price based on the input features.

## Results

We achieved an accuracy of 91% on the test data using our trained machine learning model. You can find more details about the model's performance in the `ipynb` notebook.
